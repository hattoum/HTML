	<h3>General Tips:</h3>
	<p>When playing Tinker, you have to realize that your strongest ability is your ultimate rearm and build around it.
	For this reason getting active items is your best bet. Items that increase your manapool are also great since your ultimate takes up 150/250/350 mana! Also; boots of travel.</p>
	<h3>Core Items:</h3>
	<p>Tinker builds are VERY versatile, but there are some items you just can't go without. The item that comes first to mind is boots of travel; be anywhere on the map at anytime. Your next item is soul ring, it effectively allows you to get 150 mana everytime you rearm, additionally, 800 gold is an appealing price. A blink following your core is almost imperative (consider force staff instead if you'd like) to become THE Tinker. Grabbing a bottle anytime is also legit. </p>
