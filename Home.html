	<h3> Introduction: </h3> 
	<p>Tinker is an intelligence hero whose skillset makes him extremely potent in the hands of a good player. He is among the heroes with the highest skill floors and ceilings; thus, he is more effective the better you play him.</p>
	<p>Tinker is one of the few intelligence carries in the game. His playstyle is similar to the likes of Storm Spirit and Timbersaw. He can become devastating with sufficient farm, so don't attempt to be ganking without decent farm</p>
