	<h3>Tips for Dummies:</h3>
	<p><ul class="itemz">
			<li>STAY IN THE TREES! Blinking into trees and spamming march can get you ez farm without being prone to getting ganked.</li>
			<li>Watch your mana. without mana you are a ranged creep with an annoying laugh so don't waste mana on dagoning creeps when you might need that mana</li>
			<li>Keep items in the same inventory slot everytime. This will make bashing keys a little easier.</li>
			<li>Don't eat all the farm. You are not gonna 1v5 the game, leave something for your team.</li>
			<li>Plan ahead! Seriously, if your whole plan is to jump and kill that Crytal Maiden then better go play some broken hero like PA. Playing Tinker needs you to think of how to engage, fight, and escape before doing anything.</li>
			<li>Be careful of the disgusting counter-pickers! Nyx, Storm and Andy Mage can make your game more frustrating than playing with a Russian 4-stack. </li>
			<li>Use your mobility properly, if you rearm without using your blink then you are not utilising the item. You have the second best mobility - with blink- in game after Storm Spirit.</li>
