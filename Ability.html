	<h3>Abilities</h3>
	<h4>Lazor</h4>
	<p class="p4">Pure nuke. Pure annoyance. Pure kill secure. It is important to remember how this skill blinds targets for 3 seconds. Pudge coming to lasthit? Punish him for picking pudge and lasor him, happy denying.</p>
	<h4>Missiles</h4>
	<p class="p4">Decent nuke to finish off your should-be-running targets. 320 magic at its highest level for 2 targets at ridiculous range, so make sure to position properly to hit the targets you desire. Additionally, spam this if you wish to defend a tower and make that Lich cringe.</p>
	<h4>March of the Machines</h4>
	<p class="p4">The once-almighty March of the Machines ( R.I.P in peace pre-6.82 Tinker :'(  ) sends teeny robots that hurt even carty. Use this to clear creep waves, empty your/their jungle and defend towers. If you can lay it under the teamfight area it can potentially deal crap loads of damage.</p>
	<h4>Rearm</h4>
	<p class="p4">Go start a lobby and play in -wtf mode, now wasn't that nice? Shame we can't have wtf in normal games. Oh wait, we can.</p>
	<h3>Farming Build</h3>
	<p>With this build you go 1-1-4-1 by level 7. This build emphasizes on maxing MotM and getting lots of farm early-on. With this build, you should possibly stack camps near you to further your farm. Alternatively, you can stack the ancients if you still can't get over 6.82 :( </p>
	<h3>Full Nuke Build</h3>
	<p>You know what they say: Never go full retard. They didn't say anything about going full nukes though, gasp. Max your lazors and missiles before getting any points in MotM or rearm. The purpose of this build is ez killz and utter annoyance. 600 worth of nukes 5 mins into the game is disgusting. You may (or may not) want to gank sidelanes with this build.</P>
	<h3>Mixed Build</h3>
	<p>If you aim to achieve balance between firepower and farm go with 2-2-4-1 by level 9. This gives you well over 300 nukes without sacrficing your early BoT+Soul Ring.</p>
